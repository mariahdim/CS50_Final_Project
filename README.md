## Motivations

Right now, the most accessible way for students to learn about the HUDS menu for the day is through the FlyBy daily emails, but they show a very limited information on the menu for that day. To find out more, students will have to venture to the HUDS website, which can be a bit difficult to navigate because of the overload of information that they present when showing the menu for the day. In my experience, students are more concerned about the entrees that are being served, but are also interested in knowing more than just the entrees. Personally, because of my sweet tooth, it will also be nice to see what desserts (carnival cookie?) or soup (Tomato Basil Ravioli??) will be served that day. So, these are the information that I wanted to scrape from the HUDS website so that I can reorganize them into a more intuitive fashion that is easier for busy Harvard students to navigate!

## How To Navigate HUDS Channel

This website is meant to be intuitive and easy to navigate. On the homepage, the first thing you'll see is three cards that displays the menu that will be served for the day. Specifically, these cards display the Soup of the Day, the lunch menu (entrees and desserts), and the dinner menu (also entrees and desserts).

The website also lets users look ahead! The dates for the upcoming week are displayed on the tabs, and clicking each one will let users look at what is being served on those days. Like the first tab ("Today"), there are also three cards displaying the menu: the Soup of the Day, the lunch menu, and the dinner menu.

## How to "rate" the meals for the day
Users have to be logged in before they can access the survey form. Once logged in, a tab at the top that says "My Ratings" will appear. Clicking this tab will redirect users to the form, which will ask them to check all boxes of the meals they enjoyed. This will then be saved to a database where all other ratings are saved.
